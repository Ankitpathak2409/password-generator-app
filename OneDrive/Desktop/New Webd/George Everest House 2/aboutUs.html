            <h1 class=" text-center">Mapping History: Your Guide to <br><span style="color: #809F47;"> George Everest House</span></h1>
            <p class="mx-4 mt-4 mb-5">George Everest Peak takes you to the house of Sir George Everest. Sir George Everest was a Surveyor-General of India from 1830 to 1843 and led a significant part of India’s Great Trigonometrical Survey. He was the one who hired Andrew Waugh and Radhanath Sikdar who made the first-ever observation of Mount Everest and calculated its height. 
                Situated at a height of 6578 feet above sea level, the House of Sir George Everest is legacy in ruins. The iconic house offers a mesmerizing view of the Doon valley on one side and the Aglar river and Majestic Himalayan peaks on the other.
                For a very long time, its importance was underestimated. However, in 2020 the significance of the place was well recognized by the Uttarakhand government, who then decided to renovate the heritage bungalow of Sir George and announced to convert it into a cartography museum. The museum thus will showcase the surveying instruments of Sir George, which will include theodolites and baseline bars.

                <h3 class="mx-4 mb-3">How to reach George Everest House</h3>
                <h6 class="mx-4 mb-5">The George Everest Trek can be divided into 4 different sections. <br>
                    Section I: Library Bus Stand to Hathipaon Chowk <br>Section II: Hathipaon Chowk to George Everest base <br>Section III: George Everest base to George Everest House</h6>
    
                <h6 class="mx-4 mb-4">
                    Section I: From Library Bus Stand to Hathipaon Chowk <br>
                    Trek Distance: 4 km Trek <br> Duration: 45-60 minutes</h6>
                    <p class="mx-4 mb-5">You can start the trek either from Library Bus Stand or Hathipaon Chowk based on your convenience.

                        Starting your trek from Library Bus Stand adds 4 km to the total distance. But, a scenic walk for the major part of this stretch makes it worth. It starts from a lively market and restaurant area and gradually transcends to the secluded forest road. 
                        Start walking from Library Bus Stand. Just about 200 metres away is the Mussoorie library, the oldest place in Mussoorie and has been maintained for the last 175 years.
                        From here, head towards Spring road which passes by Pine Tree Apartments and Suites. Then take a sharp left at Ashok Guest house, passing by the Laxmi General store. This lane will lead you to a junction after covering around a kilometre. Take a right turn which will lead you directly to the Hathipaon chowk.
                        The road now passes through the middle of the forest and makes you feel like you’ve entered a whole different world. Deodar trees and other coniferous flora make the walk in this road even more beautiful. Keep your eyes and ears open as you can spot a lot of birds in this region.</p>

                                    A few metres ahead from the entry gate is beautifully renovated Sir George Everest’s house. As per the locals there, the renovation/reconstruction work did not preserve the older look and beauty of the house. However, converting it into a museum will draw the attention of a lot of history enthusiasts.</p>
